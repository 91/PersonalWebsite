Developed a website to showcase portfolio and improve web development skills
This site is hosted by Google AppEngine and uses Twitter Bootstrap framework</p>
			
This site is a work in progress and I am going to spend 10 hours a week
on further development.
	
Here are my future plans for this site:</p> 
1) Improve layout and make it better for mobile
2) Add more in-depth information about projects and myself
3) Implement a development blog for future projects
4) Adhere to standard HTML/CSS coding conventions
