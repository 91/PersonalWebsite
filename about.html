			<h3>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am currently a computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin
				graduating in the Spring of 2014.  I was born and raised in the small town of
                                Graham, Texas.  I currently reside in Austin and would love to begin my career here.
				While I have an interest in a wide variety of fields in CS, the focus in my coursework
				has been in classes focused in software engineering, mobile computing, and data analytics.
				I love computer science because it is the perfect balance of theory and application;  You can 
				apply, implement, and reuse any concept without needing any other physical resources other than
				a computer.  I like to think of programming as putting a jigsaw puzzle together.  You take bunch
				of small pieces and fit them together to make a picture.  While the jigsaw puzzle has defined pieces
				and only one solution, it is the programmers job to manually define (or reuse) each piece to find 
				a way to put the picture together.
